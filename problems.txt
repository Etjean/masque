Problems I ran into when running MASQUE.

Installation with Docker :
	Link to the databases in the README is dead.

Installation with Git
	url_list.txt
		Homo sapiens : p7 no more exists -> replaced it by p12
		Danio rerio : GRCz10 no more exists -> replaced it by GRCz11
		PhiX 174 : "Enterobacteria_phage" was renamed -> "enterobacteria_phage"

	md5_check.txt
		Since some data files from url_list.txt have changed, some md5 hashes are wrong.

	install_databases.sh
		makeblastdb : problem loading "libwritedb.so" when using the binary in ncbi-blast-2.5.0+/
		
	test/data/
		Data are empty, need for downloading them.

	AlienTrimmer
		Need to run "JarMaker.sh" in AlienTrimmer directory.
